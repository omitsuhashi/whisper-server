# Issue-1 Windowing Helper Design

## Design
This design adds a single, shared helper for slicing mono waveforms by time range so both CLI streaming and the HTTP endpoint can rely on identical, testable behavior. The core API is a small dataclass, `WindowedWaveform`, holding the sliced waveform, the effective start/end seconds after clamping, and the total duration of the original waveform. The primary function `slice_waveform_by_seconds(waveform, *, sample_rate, start_seconds, end_seconds)` accepts a 1-D numpy array and a positive integer sample rate. Optional start/end inputs are normalized to finite floats; `None` is treated as default (0.0 for start, total duration for end). The helper computes `total_seconds` from `waveform.shape[-1] / sample_rate`, clamps the window to `[0, total_seconds]`, and ensures `end >= start`. It then converts seconds to sample indices via rounding and clamps indices into `[0, total_samples]`, returning the slice `waveform[start_sample:end_sample]`. If `sample_rate <= 0`, it raises `ValueError` immediately.

Error handling is intentionally strict only for the sample rate, while invalid or non-finite start/end values fall back to defaults to keep callers simple. The helper is pure and has no side effects; it does not interpret channel layouts beyond assuming mono input, and it leaves any stereo-to-mono conversion to callers as stated in the issue. Unit tests cover default full-window behavior, clamping out-of-range inputs, empty slices when `end < start`, and the invalid sample-rate error. This keeps the public surface small and stable so later issues can focus on streaming/commit logic without debating window semantics.
